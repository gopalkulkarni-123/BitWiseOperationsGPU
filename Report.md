# Benchmarking of Bitwise operations on GPU
## Introduction
This report briefly and precisely explains the benchmarking of bit-wise operations, such as AND & OR operations. The project aimed to explore ways to speed up bitwise operations by leveraging GPUs. Two such techniques are explored and benchmarked with the basic CUDA kernel that performs the same operations. At the outset, some relevant topics such as tensor cores, bit packing and CUDA kernel are explained.
